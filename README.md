# CarryProtocol_Review

This smart contract audit was prepared by [Quantstamp](https://www.quantstamp.com/), the protocol for securing smart contracts.

This security audit report follows a generic template. Future Quantstamp reports will follow a similar template and they will be fully generated by automated tools.

## Specification

Our understanding of the specification was based on the following documentation:

* [Carry Protocol README](https://github.com/carryprotocol/carry-token-crowdsale/blob/25b53a973864b6ef30d70caa14bd490935a16b55/README.md)

## Methodology

The review was conducted during 2018-May-29 through 2018-June-04 by the Quantstamp team, which included senior engineers Alex Murashkin and Leonardo Passos with reviewers Kacper Bak and Steven Stewart. 

Their procedure can be summarized as follows:

1. Code review
    1. Review of the specification
    2. Manual review of code
    3. Comparison to specification
2. Testing and automated analysis
    1. Test coverage analysis
    2. Symbolic execution (automated code path evaluation)
3. Best-practices review
4. Itemize recommendations

## Source Code

The following source code was reviewed during the audit.

# Security Audit

Quantstamp's objective was to evaluate the QuarkChain ERC20-based token and crowdsale contracts for security-related issues, code quality, and adherence to best-practices.

Possible issues include (but are not limited to):

* Transaction-ordering dependence
* Timestamp dependence
* Mishandled exceptions and call stack limits
* Unsafe external calls
* Integer overflow / underflow
* Number rounding errors
* Reentrancy and cross-function vulnerabilities
* Denial of service / logical oversights

# Test coverage

We evaluated the test coverage using truffle and solidity-coverage. The below notes outline the setup and steps that were performed.

## Setup

Testing setup: 

* Truffle v4.1.7
* TestRPC v6.0.3
* solidity-coverage v0.5.4
* Oyente v0.2.7
* Mythril v0.17.12
* truffle-flattener v1.2.5

## Steps

Steps taken to run the full test suite:

* Installed dependencies via `npm install`.

# Evaluation

## Code Coverage



## Usage of External Libraries 

The contract makes extensive usage of external libraries (created by OpenZeppelin). This practice enables relatively minimal modifications to be made in order to execute a customized crowdsale. With continued widespread use throughout the community and regular audits, these libraries will ensure that low-hanging fruit often associated with typographical errors and simplistic oversights are removed. 

## Adherence to Specification 

While minimal specification is proposed within the [README](https://github.com/carryprotocol/carry-token-crowdsale/blob/25b53a973864b6ef30d70caa14bd490935a16b55/README.md), multiple checks and constants are presented through the Truffle project to ensure intended actions are successfully performed.

# Disclosure

## Purpose of report

The scope of our review is limited to a review of Solidity code and only the source code we note as being within the scope of our review within this report. Cryptographic tokens are emergent technologies and carry with them high levels of technical risk and uncertainty. The Solidity language itself remains under development and is subject to unknown risks and flaws. The review does not extend to the compiler layer, or any other areas beyond Solidity that could present security risks.

The report is not an endorsement or indictment of any particular project or team, and the report does not guarantee the security of any particular project. This report does not consider, and should not be interpreted as considering or having any bearing on, the potential economics of a token, token sale or any other product, service or other asset.

No third party should rely on the reports in any way, including for the purpose of making any decisions to buy or sell any token, product, service or other asset. Specifically, for the avoidance of doubt, this report does not constitute investment advice, is not intended to be relied upon as investment advice, is not an endorsement of this project or team, and it is not a guarantee as to the absolute security of the project.
